        <h3>Blog #2: OOP, Depression, and moving forward</h3>
        <p>I think I have hit one of my major roadblocks in learning how to program. Yes, I am stuck in studying some programming concept but the real reason that I am stuck is because of external factors.</p>
        <p>Honestly speaking, I am feeling kind of depressed right now due to personal issues.</p>
        <p>My study schedule took a hard hit from it. My learning was slower and I had a hard time dissecting and understanding the concepts.</p>
        <p>FYI, if ever someone is reading this, I put a deadline to myself that I should be somewhat baseline-level competent and job-ready by around December this year.</p>
        <p>Looking at my schedule it seems that I am delayed by more than a week already. It is what it is. No crying over spilled milk. All I have to do is to move forward, right?</p>
        <p>It also does not help that I'm studying a real new concept called Object-Oriented Programming or also known by software engineers as OOP. It is kind of a programming style or convetion that makes code neat, more readable, and reusable. It is similar to the concept of reusable parts that we use in machineries today.</p>
        <p>OOP has four major pillars, namely:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Abstraction</li>
            <li>Encapsulation</li>
            <li>Inheritance</li>
            <li>Polymorphism</li>
        </ul>
        <p><i>I hope I got all four correct since I just got them straight from memory and no help from Google or my notes.</i></p>
        <p>I kind of understand the concepts at a surface level but I still lack exposure. I am gonna compensate my lack of exposure by dedicating this week in practicing OOP concepts.</p>
        <p>Hopefully I can finish and be confident as soon as possible and move on to the next topic.</p>
        <p><b>Back to the feeling of being depressed</b></p>
        <p>I know it sucks, but this is not the first time that I experienced this. I had a phase during my university years that it seems like the whole world is against me. That's just life is. It can be both beautiful and brutal at the same time.</p>
        <p>I am very thankful to my support system who keeps me sane and serve as my inspiration to wake up and seize the day. Shoutout to my very beautiful wife, Ruffa, and my daugther, Vivi. You are the sunshine to my life.</p>
        <p>It ain't easy but I am still keeping my word that I will make it.</p>
        <p>I also apologize to my future readers (if there are any) if this blog post is so damn emotional.</p>
        <p>Being a software engineer isn't just about computers and programming. Sometimes we have to deal with this kind of situations.</p>
        <p>So, I guess that's it for today. Back to studying.</p>

        <h3>Blog #1: Let there be light</h3>
        <p><i>The first day - light was created.</i></p>

        <p>Hello, world!</p>

        <p>Brief background: I am a mid-level civil engineer who wants to shift in tech since this is my childhood dream and have been studying the concepts of programming and software development since the start of year 2022, but it seems like I still do not know <b>SHIT</b>. Excuse the language, but I just want to express how I really feel. It feels like I wasted precious amount of time chasing through tails and achieving nothing in value.</p>

        <p>I scrambled through different free online resources to learn as much as I can but it seems that this is a bad way of learning and I'm stuck in what people call a "tutorial hell".</p>

        <p>To slowly kick myself out of this endless loop, I decided to finally make my own blog-slash-portfolio website. Basically a place online wherein I'll dump and put anything tech-related that I create.</p>

        <p>I'm naming this project "Project Genesis" which is inspired from the name of the first book of the Hebrew Bible and the Christian Old Testament. It is an account of the creation of the world -- and literally my very first personal and "real world" project coming to tech. I somewhat view this project as creating my own world, hence the name. This website will be initially made with plain HTML only, no CSS, no whatever. I will improve this site from time to time as I review and solidify my knowledge in web development fundamentals. Hopefully, I can add features that will make my website stand out among the crowd.</p>

        <p>My main goal is to be a very competent software engineer but I face a big challenge: I do not have any formal education related to computer science, computer engineering, IT, whatever. Nevertheless, I have heard stories of people who made it without a degree and dedicated myself to follow their steps. That does not mean that I am not aware of the people on the other side of the coin who failed and did not make it, which at the same time, serve my inspiration and my day-to-day reality check to remind me to take this very seriously because the stakes are too damn high and I cannot afford more failures (I consider myself as one, as of the moment. Hope the feeling will pass).</p>

        <p>Currently, these are the topics that I am studying:
            <ul>
                <li>Google Data Analytics*</li>
                <li>Google IT Support*</li>
                <li>App Academy Open - Web Development</li>
                <li>Core Java</li>
                <li>AWS re/Start (AWS Cloud Practitioner class)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>Because of the uncertainty brought by having no computer degree/background and job competition, I am just grabbing and learning whatever I can. More entries means more chances of winning, right? Sounds crazy, I know. But sometimes we need a little bit of crazy in life.</p>

        <p>* - free Coursera courses sponsored by Globe Telecom. Thank you guys!</p>

        <p>I am currently unemplyed as of typing. Last night, I cannot sleep simply just because of the pressure and the noise behind my head that kept telling "what if I can't make it?".
        Later I realized that I learn best by doing and not by mindlessly following an endless loop of tutorials and solving Leetcode questions, hence the conception of this website. So, here we go. Day one of Project Genesis. <i>Let there be light</i>. Now I'm enlightened on what I really want to do and what I really want to be in life...</p>

        <p>I want to change the world for the better, even by a very little drop, through software.</p>

        <p>And yup I won't lie, the economy here in the Philippines is slowly failing and I need to upskill and be prepared for whatever challenge may come in the future. After all, the needs of my family comes first.</p>

        <p>As breadwinners, we are expected to win. So that's what I'll do.</p>

        <p>I will make it happen.</p>
